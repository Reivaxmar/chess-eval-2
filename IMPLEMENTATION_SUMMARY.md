# Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement Requirements

The task was to implement a FastAPI backend with Stockfish integration for chess game analysis with the following requirements:

### 1. GET /games/{username}
- Fetch PGNs via Chess.com API
- ✅ **Implemented** at `/games/{username}`
- Returns list of recent games with PGN data

### 2. POST /analyze
- Input: PGN string
- Output: JSON list of moves with {move, eval, delta, label}
- ✅ **Implemented** at `/analyze`
- Accepts PGN in request body and returns move analysis

### 3. Move Classification (Centipawn Loss)
- <20: Best
- 20-50: Excellent
- 50-150: Good
- 150-300: Inaccuracy
- 300-600: Mistake
- >600: Blunder
- ✅ **Implemented** with correct thresholds

## Implementation Details

### New Endpoints

1. **GET /games/{username}**
   - Fetches recent games from Chess.com API
   - Returns list with PGN, white/black players, and game URL
   - Implements retry logic for rate limiting

2. **POST /analyze**
   - Accepts: `{"pgn": "PGN string"}`
   - Returns: Array of `{move: string, eval: float, delta: float, label: string}`
   - Uses Stockfish for position evaluation
   - Classifies moves based on centipawn loss

### Classification System

The move classification uses centipawn loss calculation:
```python
# After converting evaluation to player's perspective:
delta = eval_after - eval_before  # Change from player's perspective
centipawn_loss = round(-delta * 100, 1)  # Convert to positive centipawns lost
```

Thresholds are applied with exclusive upper bounds:
- [0, 20): Best
- [20, 50): Excellent
- [50, 150): Good
- [150, 300): Inaccuracy
- [300, 600): Mistake
- [600, ∞): Blunder

### Backward Compatibility

The existing `/api/games/{username}` and `/api/analyze` endpoints remain functional for compatibility with the existing frontend.

## Files Modified

1. **backend/main.py**
   - Added `AnalyzeRequest` model
   - Added `MoveAnalysisSimple` model
   - Updated `classify_move()` function with centipawn loss thresholds
   - Added `GET /games/{username}` endpoint
   - Added `POST /analyze` endpoint
   - Maintained existing `/api/games` and `/api/analyze` endpoints

2. **README.md**
   - Updated move classification documentation
   - Added new endpoint documentation
   - Updated examples

3. **API_EXAMPLES.md** (new)
   - Comprehensive API usage examples
   - Python and JavaScript code samples
   - Curl command examples

## Libraries Used

As specified in requirements.txt:
- fastapi==0.109.0
- python-chess==1.999
- requests==2.31.0
- uvicorn[standard]==0.27.0
- pydantic==2.5.3

## Testing

All functionality has been tested:
1. ✅ Classification system with boundary conditions
2. ✅ POST /analyze endpoint with sample PGNs
3. ✅ GET /games/{username} endpoint (structure validated)
4. ✅ Backward compatibility with existing endpoints
5. ✅ Output format matches {move, eval, delta, label}

## Example Usage

```bash
# Start the server
cd backend
python main.py

# Analyze a game
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"pgn": "[Event \"Test\"]\n\n1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 *"}'
```

Response:
```json
[
  {
    "move": "e4",
    "eval": -0.46,
    "delta": -0.83,
    "label": "Good"
  },
  {
    "move": "e5",
    "eval": 0.32,
    "delta": -0.78,
    "label": "Good"
  },
  ...
]
```

## Summary

✅ All problem statement requirements have been successfully implemented
✅ Centipawn-based move classification is accurate
✅ Both new endpoints are functional and tested
✅ Backward compatibility is maintained
✅ Comprehensive documentation added
